# Resume Pro-Tips

Most people don't need more experience they just need to sound like they've already earned trust. These five lines instantly make you sound more senior:

1 "Responsible for managing projects" -> "Led projects from idea to delivery hit every deadline."
    
    "Responsible" is filler. Seniors show ownership, not obligation.

2.	"Worked with clients" -> "Partnered with clients to fix gaps  raised satisfaction by 20%."

    "Worked with" sounds like you followed orders. "Partnered" shows trust and impact.

3.	"Assisted with financial reporting" -> "Built reports leadership used for budget decisions."

    "Assisted" kills authority. Always show the result of your work.

4.	"Helped with operations" -> "Fixed messy processes saved the team hours each week."

    "Helped" is vague. "Fixed" tells the recruiter you solve problems.

5.	"Looking to grow my skills" -> "I bring structure, clarity, and accountability."

    Juniors talk about what they want. Seniors talk about what they bring.
